A web application (web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the internet through a browser interface. Web services are web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain web apps.

Developers design web applications for a wide variety of uses and users, from an organization to an individual for numerous reasons. Commonly used web applications can include webmail, online calculators, social networking or e-commerce shops. While users can only access some web apps by a specific browser, most are available no matter the browser.

Unlike traditional desktop applications that are installed on a computer, web apps can be used on any device with a web browser, including smartphones, tablets and desktops.
